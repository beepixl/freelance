=== WC Paid Listings ===
Contributors: mikejolley
Requires at least: 3.8
Tested up to: 4.0
Stable tag: 2.1.3
License: GNU General Public License v3.0

Add paid listing functionality via WooCommerce. Create 'job packages' as products with their own price, listing duration, listing limit, and job featured status and either sell them via your store or during the job submission process.

A user's packages are shown on their account page and can be used to post future jobs if they allow more than 1 job listing.

Usage instructions for this plugin can be found on the wiki: [https://github.com/mikejolley/WP-Job-Manager/wiki/WooCommerce-Paid-Listings](https://github.com/mikejolley/WP-Job-Manager/wiki/WooCommerce-Paid-Listings).

= Support Policy =

I will happily patch any confirmed bugs with this plugin, however, I will not offer support for:

1. Customisations of this plugin or any plugins it relies upon
2. Conflicts with "premium" themes from ThemeForest and similar marketplaces (due to bad practice and not being readily available to test)
3. CSS Styling (this is customisation work)
4. WooCommerce help.

If you need help with customisation you will need to find and hire a developer capable of making the changes.
